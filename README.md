# Charli XCX â€“ Vroom Vroom (Lil Data TidalCycles live coding edit)

Time to say goodbye - until I finish my PhD.

Here's a parting gift, everyone who booked me in the last year, and everyone who listened to my music and supported me.

But wait! It's not over yet - you have a final chance to catch me July 11th at Rye Wax w/ wonder boy umru and friends: https://www.facebook.com/events/2377156248997543/

I leave you with a question. What kind of doctor should Doctor Data be? For good or for evil? Creation or destruction? Friend or foe?
